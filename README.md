# React Test Task

Small demo of React & Redux Isomorphic project.

## Quickstart (Development)

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Quickstart (Production)

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run bs
```

## Available Commands

1. `npm run start` - starts the development server with hot reloading enabled

2. `npm run bs` - bundles the code and starts the production server

3. `npm run test` - start the test runner

### Caveats

#### FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
To make the hot reloading of CSS work, we are not extracting CSS in development. Ideally, during server rendering, we will be extracting CSS, and we will get a .css file, and we can use it in the html template. That's what we are doing in production.

In development, after all scripts get loaded, react loads the CSS as BLOBs. That's why there is a second of FOUC in development.

#### Client and Server Markup Mismatch
This warning is visible only on development and totally harmless. This occurs to hash difference in `react-router`. To solve it, react router docs asks you to use `match` function. If we use `match`, `react-hot-reloader` stops working.
